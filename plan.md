Create a HIIT Timer that can be hosted for my girlfriend

Functionality:
Iâ€™d like a timer where I can have like a cycle where eg 1.5mins, rest, 1min, rest, 45s, rest, 30s, rest. Rest period is the same though

So each cycle can have N rounds, which the user can pick. Each cycle has a fixed rest period. For each of the rounds, user can pick how long it lasts.

User can select number of cycles in the beginning as well.
